Duct

Preface
~~~~~~~

Duct is a data-driven framework for writing server-side applications
in the Clojure_ programming language. This guide is intended as an
in-depth explanation of how to use Duct, and will focus on web
applications in particular.

This guide assumes you have a working knowledge of Clojure code, and
that you have Leiningen_ installed. A basic understanding of Ring_
will also be useful, but not required.
